<!--when you use display block then you can set height and width 
but when you use display:inline then the box will be gone and it will in same line with small area and you cannot set its height and width-->

<!-- Display : Inline-block means the display will be in same line but the features will be of block means it will be a line of box with set height and width-->

<!--Display: None; so here the box one will be gone with the space as well and box2 will appear in box 1 and continue
but when we did visibility hidden the box was hidden but space was still there but in display none case the box and the space both will be gone. -->
